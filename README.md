# TP-OC2-MIPS-STALL-FORWARDING

Processor acrchiteture system implemented in Verilog with Stall functionality for memory and brach instructions and Forwarding technology
using a ScoreBoard.

Main file is mips_multi.v but memory initialization and structural .mif and .vhd files can also be found, as well as the Registers file, along with a 7-Seg Display interface.

This was made in group for OC2, Organização de Computadores 2, or Computer Architecture Organization 2 discipline, and tested
with Intel FPGA Altera hardware. The software used for development was the Quartus Prime 16.1 Lite Edition.
